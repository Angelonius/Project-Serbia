# Project-Serbia
This is a mod for UnCiv where I add the medieval Kingdom of Serbia.

Disclaimer:
In this mod, I have added in the lands of Kosovo, parts of North Macedonia and parts of Albania. This is solely for historical accuracy. This is not an endorsement for Serbian nationalist claims on any part of the Balkans.

CHANGELOG: v.1.1 Updated the stats on the Hajduk, added in the Fitiljaca
